# harvester

Hooks into Harvest API
Provides a simple web interface (not yet; but later)
Calculates employee payroll info based on California laws (overtime, doubletime, etc)

This is a work in progress...

TODO:
Stub/mock Harvest API integration so the specs can work properly without requiring credentials and web requests... 
Rename the project to harvest_payroll
